## Is this project alive?????

Yes! Just because there are no commits for a longer period of time, does not mean the project is dead. I am a human being with a life and TL never was an still is not my top priority. I will always try to keep it running if there are breaking changes, but new features can take time. If I dicide to discontinue TL (which is very unlikely) you WILL be informed very clearly.

## Download & Requirements
- Requires .NET Framework 4.8
- Requires Windows 7 SP1 64 Bit or higher

The Installer is available [HERE](https://github.com/Franiac/TwitchLeecher/releases)

Once installed, future releases will automatically update current installations with a single click!

## What is the difference compared to other VOD downloaders?

Nearly all of the well known VOD downloaders execute the download process via FFMPEG's integrated download capabilities. However, this is extremely slow. The download speed rarely exceeds 1.5Mbit even if the internet connection is 100 times faster. Twitch Leecher does not use FFMPEG for download tasks at all. It downloads thousands of small video chunks in parallel while using all of the available bandwidth of your internet connection. As soon as all video chunks are downloaded, FFMPEG is only used to merge those chunks together in order to create a single video file again.
